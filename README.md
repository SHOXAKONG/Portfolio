├── config/                   # Django configuration settings (settings, urls, wsgi)
├── portfolio/                # Main app containing models, views, templates, and static files
│   ├── migrations/           # Database migrations
│   ├── static/               # Static assets: CSS, JavaScript, images

├── manage.py                 # Django's command-line utility
└── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies list
```

### Configuration

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Consider using environment variables for sensitive settings. Create a `.env` file (and add it to `.gitignore`) for variables such as `DEBUG`, `SECRET_KEY`, and database credentials.
- **Settings Management:**  
  The `config` directory contains your Django settings. For production, create a separate settings file (e.g., `production.py`) to override development settings, especially for security and performance.

## Deployment

There are several options to deploy your portfolio:

- **Heroku:** Use the provided `Procfile` and adjust the settings for a Heroku environment.
- **Docker:** Create a `Dockerfile` and use Docker Compose for containerized deployment.
- **Cloud Providers:** AWS, DigitalOcean, or Google Cloud Platform can host your Django application.
  
Be sure to disable `DEBUG` mode and configure allowed hosts before deploying. You may also need to set up static file storage (e.g., using Amazon S3) for production.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:**  
  Write unit tests for your models, views, and forms. Django's testing framework is built-in, and you can run tests using:
  
  ```bash
  python manage.py test
  ```
- **Linting & Code Quality:**  
  Use tools like `flake8` or `black` to maintain code quality and consistency.
- **Continuous Integration:**  
  Consider integrating GitHub Actions or Travis CI to automate testing with each commit.

## Roadmap

- **Feature Enhancements:**
  - Implement a blog module with rich text editing.
  - Add support for user comments and project ratings.
  - Integrate with third-party APIs for enhanced functionality.
- **UI/UX Improvements:**
  - Advanced animations and transitions for better user experience.
  - Dark mode toggle with persistent user settings.
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Optimize static files and images.
  - Introduce caching strategies to reduce load times.
- **Internationalization (i18n):**
  - Support multiple languages and localization features.
