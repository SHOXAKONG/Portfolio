# Portfolio Project

A Django REST Framework–powered backend for managing your portfolio data. This project provides a robust API to create, read, update, and delete portfolio items such as projects, experiences, and skills. It’s built with modularity and scalability in mind, making it easy to update content and deploy to production without a frontend layer.

## Overview

This repository contains a RESTful API for a portfolio website built using Django and Django REST Framework. It’s intended for professionals who wish to manage portfolio content (projects, work experiences, skills, etc.) through a dedicated API. This backend can be used on its own or integrated with a frontend (mobile or web) for a full-stack solution.

## Features

- **RESTful API Endpoints:** Create, retrieve, update, and delete portfolio data using standard HTTP methods.
- **Django REST Framework:** Leveraging DRF’s powerful tools for authentication, serialization, and view handling.
- **Modular Design:** Easy-to-maintain and extend codebase with clear separation between configuration and application logic.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Use environment variables to securely manage sensitive settings.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with any frontend or mobile application.

## Technologies

- **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database:** SQLite by default (easily configurable for PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Deployment:** Compatible with Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, Docker, etc.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed on your system
- `pip` package manager
- (Optional) `virtualenv` or `venv` for creating isolated environments

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SHOXAKONG/Portfolio.git
   cd Portfolio
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Apply Database Migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a Superuser (for accessing the Django admin):**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the API:**

   Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to explore the browsable API endpoints provided by Django REST Framework.

## Usage

- **API Endpoints:**  
  The API is structured to expose endpoints for your portfolio data. For example, you might have endpoints like `/api/projects/` or `/api/experiences/`. Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or the built-in DRF browsable API to test and interact with your endpoints.
  
- **Admin Panel:**  
  Access [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) to manage your portfolio content using Django’s admin interface.

- **Authentication:**  
  Depending on your configuration, you can use DRF’s built-in authentication methods (e.g., Token Authentication) to secure your API endpoints.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env File)

This project uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive settings and configuration parameters. Using a `.env` file keeps your `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials, and other sensitive information out of version control.

#### How to Use the `.env` File

1. **Create a `.env` File:**

   In the root directory (where `manage.py` is located), create a file named `.env`. Ensure that `.env` is added to your `.gitignore` file.

2. **Define Your Environment Variables:**

   In your `.env` file, define your variables in the following format:

   ```dotenv
   # General Settings
   DEBUG=True
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

   # Database Configuration
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
   # For PostgreSQL, you might use:
   # DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DBNAME

   # Allowed Hosts (comma-separated)
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost
   ```

3. **Load Environment Variables in Django Settings:**

   Install and use a package like [django-environ](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/) to load these variables. In your settings file (e.g., `config/settings.py`), add:

   ```python
   import os
   import environ

   # Initialize environment variables
   env = environ.Env(
       DEBUG=(bool, False)
   )

   # Read the .env file
   environ.Env.read_env(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '.env'))

   # Set variables from the .env file
   DEBUG = env('DEBUG')
   SECRET_KEY = env('SECRET_KEY')
   DATABASES = {
       'default': env.db(),
   }
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = env.list('ALLOWED_HOSTS')
   ```

4. **Environment-Specific Files:**

   For different environments (development, staging, production), consider creating separate `.env` files (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.production`) and loading the appropriate one based on your environment.

5. **Security Best Practices:**

   - **Never share your `.env` file publicly.**
   - **Use appropriate values for production (e.g., set `DEBUG=False`).**
   - **Consider secret management services for production secrets.**

## Deployment

Several deployment options are available for this API:

- **Heroku:** Configure a `Procfile` and adjust settings for Heroku deployment.
- **Docker:** Create a `Dockerfile` and use Docker Compose for containerized deployment.
- **Cloud Providers:** Deploy on AWS, DigitalOcean, or Google Cloud Platform with the appropriate configurations.

Before deploying, remember to disable `DEBUG` mode, configure your allowed hosts, and set up proper static file storage if needed for administrative purposes.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:**  
  Write tests for your models, views, and serializers using Django's built-in testing framework. Run tests with:

  ```bash
  python manage.py test
  ```

- **Linting & Code Quality:**  
  Use tools like `flake8` or `black` to maintain code consistency.

- **Continuous Integration:**  
  Integrate CI tools like GitHub Actions or Travis CI to automatically run tests with every commit.

## Roadmap

- **Feature Enhancements:**
  - Expand API endpoints to cover more portfolio data (e.g., user feedback, comments).
  - Implement advanced authentication and permission handling.
  - Integrate with third-party services for additional functionality.
- **Performance Improvements:**
  - Optimize database queries and introduce caching strategies.
- **Documentation:**
  - Provide comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or DRF's built-in docs.
- **Internationalization (i18n):**
  - Add support for multiple languages.
